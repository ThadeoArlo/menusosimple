# menusosimple
menusosimple is made to bo a very simple menu button on the top left of a website layout

its made within a php file, so you can locatate the file in your website repository and use php include to have it on the main website. 

The css is not much and the javascript is only a few lines. Its very light-weight so it is guaranteed to not slow down page load


This is made open source so you can modify it anyway you want or put suggestions on the comments issue to report any bug or suggest a feature.

live demo can be found in my website  http://www.arlora.co.nf
